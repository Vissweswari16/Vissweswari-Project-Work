        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>Web development offers a variety of projects to practice and showcase your skills. 
            Beginners can start with simple projects like a personal portfolio website, product landing page, recipe website, event or conference website, or a basic blog page. 
            Once comfortable with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, intermediate projects such as a to-do list app, quiz app, weather app using APIs, expense tracker, or image gallery with lightbox are great for learning DOM interaction. 
            For advanced learners, full-stack projects like an e-commerce store, blog with CMS, online chat application, job board website, or learning management system can demonstrate backend integration and complex functionality. 
            Building at least one beginner, one intermediate, and one advanced project will create a strong and balanced portfolio.</p>
